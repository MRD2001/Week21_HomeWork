Advanced Solidity - Martial Token Crowsale

## Background

After waiting for years and passing several tests, the Martian Aerospace Agency selected you to become part of the first human colony on Mars. As a prominent fintech professional, they chose you to lead a project developing a monetary system for the new Mars colony. You decided to base this new system on blockchain technology and to define a new cryptocurrency named KaseiCoin. (Kasei means Mars in Japanese.)
KaseiCoin will be a fungible token that’s ERC-20 compliant. You’ll launch a crowdsale that will allow people who are moving to Mars to convert their earthling money to KaseiCoin.

## Instructions

The steps for this assignment are divided into the following subsections:


Create the KaseiCoin Token Contract


Create the KaseiCoin Crowdsale Contract


Create the KaseiCoin Deployer Contract


Deploy and Test the Crowdsale on a Local Blockchain


Optional: Extend the Crowdsale Contract by Using OpenZeppelin
